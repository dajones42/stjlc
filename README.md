# St. Johnsbury & Lamoille County Railroad

This is a Open Rails route that represents the St. Johnsbury & Lamoille County
Railroad in the late 1940s to early 1950s.  The railroad's name was
St. Johnsbury & Lake Champlain before 1948.

This route was built on Linux using mostly home made tools.  It was tested
using OR 1.3.1 run via Wine.  Testing using MSTS hasn't been attempted, but
probably will not work due to a large number of missing .sd files.

## Installation

Copy or clone into the ROUTES directory of an Microsoft Train Simulator
installation or miniroute that has Scalerail.

## Credits

Most of the shapes and textures in this route were created by others.
