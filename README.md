# St. Johnsbury & Lamoille County Railroad

This is an Open Rails route that represents the St. Johnsbury & Lamoille County
Railroad in the late 1940s to early 1950s.  The railroad's name was
St. Johnsbury & Lake Champlain before 1948.

This is a work in progress.  Track work is mostly done, although I plan on
making custom shapes for the two crossings in the future.  Most towns have
track side building only.  There are no activities, but there are paths that
start at all locations listed in the time table (see stjlcett93April271947.pdf).

This route was built on Linux using mostly home made tools.  It was tested
using OR 1.3.1 run via Wine.  Will not work in MSTS.

## Installation

Copy or clone into the ROUTES directory of an Microsoft Train Simulator
installation or miniroute.  You will need a version of the global tsection.dat
that contains some Scale Rail shapes, but you don't know the shapes themselves.
I use build 00038.

## Credits

Most of the shapes and textures in this route were created by others,
including: Ron Picardi, Paul Charland, Hank Sundermeyer, Gary Sprandel,
Doug Relyea, Ted Curphey, Simon van de Laak, Brad Miles, Chris Gerlach,
Jared Singletary, Tom Werb, John Fleming, Tim Muir, Steven West,
Joe Cooney, Philip M. Voxland, Bernard Lafargue, Norbert Rieger, Mark Ratledge
and Mike Deming.

Many of these shapes and textures require that the route be distributed
free of charge.
